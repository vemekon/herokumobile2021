        <h4>
          Unilever is a business founded on a sense of purpose, and our unique
          heritage still shapes the way we do business today.
        </h4>
        <p>
          It was “to make technology accessible to the masses; to foster an
          effective and efficient work environment, that life may be more
          enjoyable and rewarding for the people who use our products”.
          <br />
          <br /> That sense of purpose and mission has always been part of
          Unilever’s culture. In the 21st century, we’re still helping people to
          use technology, work efficient and get more out of life – and our
          purpose as a business is ‘making accessible to the masses’.
